    <h1>The Sacraments</h1>

    <p>
        The sacraments are efficacious signs of grace, instituted by Christ and entrusted to the Church, by which divine life is dispensed to us. There are seven sacraments, touching all the stages and all the important moments of Christian life (see <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P36.HTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CCC 1210</a>).

            <h2><a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P3G.HTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baptism</a></h2>
            <p>
                The basis of the whole Christian life, the gateway to life in the Spirit, and the door which gives access to the other sacraments. Through Baptism we are freed from sin and reborn as sons of God; we become members of Christ, are incorporated into the Church and made sharers in her mission.

            <h2><a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P3M.HTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Confirmation</a></h2>
            <p>
                Confirmation enriches the baptized with a special strength of the Holy Spirit. It binds us more perfectly to the Church and obliges us to spread and defend the faith by word and deed as true witnesses of Christ.

        <section>
            <h2><a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P3W.HTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Eucharist</a></h2>
            <p>
                The source and summit of the Christian life. In the Eucharist, the bread and wine become the true Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of Jesus Christ. By receiving Holy Communion, we are united intimately with Christ and with one another.

            <h2><a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P4C.HTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reconciliation</a></h2>
            <p>
                Also known as Confession or Penance. In this sacrament, through the priest's absolution, God grants pardon for sins committed after Baptism. It reconciles us with God and with the Church.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2><a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P4K.HTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anointing of the Sick</a></h2>
            <p>
                By the sacred anointing of the sick and the prayer of the priests the whole Church commends those who are ill to the suffering and glorified Lord, that he may raise them up and save them.
            </p>

            <h2><a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P4S.HTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Holy Orders</a></h2>
            <p>
                The sacrament through which the mission entrusted by Christ to his apostles continues to be exercised in the Church until the end of time. It includes three degrees: episcopate (bishops), presbyterate (priests), and diaconate (deacons).

            <h2><a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P50.HTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matrimony</a></h2>
            <p>
                The matrimonial covenant, by which a man and a woman establish between themselves a partnership of the whole of life, is by its nature ordered toward the good of the spouses and the procreation and education of offspring.
