    <h1>What Catholics Believe</h1>
    <p>The revelation of God to humanity, entrusted to the Church</p>
</section>

<main id="main-content">
    <p class="reveal">
        The Catholic faith is built upon the revelation of God to humanity, entrusted to the Church. It is not a collection of opinions, but a coherent body of truth that illuminates the meaning of our existence.
    </p>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-sun"></i> The Most Holy Trinity</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        We believe in one God who is eternally three distinct persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. This is the central mystery of the Christian faith (see <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P17.HTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CCC 232-267</a>). The Trinity is a communion of love, and we are created in the image of this love.
    </p>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-cross"></i> Jesus Christ</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        We believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Second Person of the Trinity, who became man to save us from sin and death. He is fully God and fully man (see <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1J.HTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CCC 464-483</a>). Through his life, passion, death, and resurrection, he opened the gates of heaven and reconciled humanity with God.
    </p>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-church"></i> The Church</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        We believe that the Catholic Church is the Body of Christ on earth, established by Jesus himself (see <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P27.HTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CCC 751-776</a>). It is "one, holy, catholic, and apostolic." Through the Church, Christ continues his saving work, dispensing grace and teaching the truth with authority.
    </p>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i> Scripture and Tradition</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        Divine Revelation is transmitted through two distinct but closely connected modes: <a href="https://bible.usccb.org/bible" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sacred Scripture (the Bible)</a> and Sacred Tradition. Together, they form a single deposit of faith. The <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__PM.HTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magisterium</a>—the teaching office of the Church—serves this deposit by authentically interpreting the Word of God.
    </p>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-dove"></i> Salvation and Grace</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        We believe that we are saved by grace through faith and works (see <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P6S.HTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CCC 1987-2029</a>). Salvation is a free gift from God, but we must cooperate with that gift through our choices and actions. The goal of our life is beatitude: eternal happiness with God in heaven.
    </p>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-bread-slice"></i> The Real Presence in the Eucharist</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        Catholics believe that in the Eucharist, the bread and wine truly become the Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of Jesus Christ. This change is called <em>transubstantiation</em>. The Eucharist is not a mere symbol; it is Christ himself, substantially present under the appearances of bread and wine. Jesus declared: "This is my body" and "This is my blood" (see <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P43.HTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CCC 1373-1381</a>). The Eucharist is "the source and summit of the Christian life" (Lumen Gentium, 11).
    </p>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-person-praying"></i> The Blessed Virgin Mary</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        Mary holds a unique place in the Catholic faith as the Mother of God (<em>Theotokos</em>). She was conceived without original sin (the Immaculate Conception), consented freely to become the mother of the Savior, remained a virgin, and was assumed body and soul into heaven at the end of her earthly life. Catholics do not worship Mary; we honor her as the greatest of all the saints and ask for her powerful intercession. "All generations will call me blessed" (Luke 1:48). See <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2C.HTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CCC 484-511</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-apple-whole"></i> Original Sin</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        Through the disobedience of our first parents, Adam and Eve, sin entered the world, and with it, death and suffering. Every human being (except Mary, by a singular grace) inherits this fallen state called original sin—not a personal fault, but a deprivation of original holiness and justice. Baptism washes away original sin and restores the life of grace, though its effects (concupiscence, suffering, and death) remain. See <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1C.HTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CCC 396-421</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-fire"></i> Purgatory</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        Those who die in God's grace but are not yet fully purified undergo a process of purification called Purgatory, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter heaven. Purgatory is not a "second chance" but a mercy of God for those already assured of salvation. The Church has always prayed for the dead, and Scripture itself supports this practice: "It is a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead, that they may be loosed from sins" (2 Maccabees 12:46). See <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2N.HTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CCC 1030-1032</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-scale-balanced"></i> The Moral Law</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        God has inscribed a natural moral law in the human heart, and he revealed it definitively in the Ten Commandments and the teaching of Christ. The two Great Commandments summarize the whole law: love God with all your heart, soul, and mind, and love your neighbor as yourself (Matthew 22:37-40). The Church teaches that there are acts which are intrinsically evil and can never be justified, regardless of circumstances or intentions. The moral life is not a burden but a response of love to the God who first loved us. See <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P6B.HTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CCC 1949-1986</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-users"></i> The Communion of Saints</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        The Church is not limited to those currently living on earth. It includes the saints in heaven and the souls in purgatory. We are all united in the Body of Christ. We ask the saints, and especially Mary, the Mother of God, to pray for us, just as we ask our friends on earth to pray for us.
    </p>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-list-check"></i> The Precepts of the Church</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        The Precepts of the Church are the minimum level of commitment required of the faithful (see <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P75.HTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CCC 2041-2043</a>).
    </p>
    <ul class="reveal">
        <li>You shall attend Mass on Sundays and on holy days of obligation and rest from servile labor.</li>
        <li>You shall confess your sins at least once a year.</li>
        <li>You shall receive the sacrament of the Eucharist at least during the Easter season.</li>
        <li>You shall observe the days of fasting and abstinence established by the Church.</li>
        <li>You shall help to provide for the needs of the Church.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-hourglass-half"></i> The Four Last Things</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        The Church teaches that every human life has an eternal destiny. The "Four Last Things" are Death, Judgment, Heaven, and Hell. At the moment of death, each soul undergoes a particular judgment. Those who die in God's grace and friendship and are perfectly purified live for ever with Christ in Heaven. Those who die in God's grace, but are still imperfectly purified, are assured of their eternal salvation; but after death they undergo purification (Purgatory), so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven. Those who die in a state of mortal sin, without repentance, separate themselves from God forever (Hell).
