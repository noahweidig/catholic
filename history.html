    <h1>Church History</h1>
    <p>The Holy Spirit guiding the People of God through time</p>
</section>

<main>
    <p class="reveal">
        The history of the Church is the story of the Holy Spirit guiding the People of God through time. It is a history of saints and sinners, of struggle and triumph, all centered on the person of Jesus Christ.
    </p>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-fire-flame-curved"></i> The Apostolic Age (c. 33–100 AD)</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        The Church began at Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit descended upon the Apostles, empowering them to preach the Gospel to all nations. Led by Peter and Paul, the early Christians spread the faith throughout the Roman Empire, often facing severe persecution. This era gave us the New Testament writings and the Didache.
    </p>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-ribbon"></i> The Age of Martyrs (c. 100–313 AD)</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        For the first three centuries, Christianity was illegal. Thousands of believers, from bishops like Ignatius of Antioch to young women like Agnes and Perpetua, gave their lives rather than deny Christ. As Tertullian famously wrote, "The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church." Despite the danger, the faith grew rapidly.
    </p>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-landmark"></i> The Church Fathers and the Councils (c. 313–600 AD)</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        With the Edict of Milan in 313 AD, Emperor Constantine legalized Christianity. This allowed the Church to clarify her teachings publicly. Great thinkers known as the Church Fathers (such as Augustine, Ambrose, and Athanasius) defended the faith against heresies. Ecumenical Councils were held to define core doctrines:
    </p>
    <ul class="reveal">
        <li><strong>Council of Nicaea (325 AD):</strong> Affirmed that Jesus is truly God, of the same substance (consubstantial) as the Father.</li>
        <li><strong>Council of Ephesus (431 AD):</strong> Proclaimed Mary as <em>Theotokos</em>, the Mother of God.</li>
        <li><strong>Council of Chalcedon (451 AD):</strong> Defined that Jesus is one person with two natures, fully human and fully divine.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-mountain"></i> Monasticism</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        As persecution ceased, some sought a "white martyrdom" of self-denial. St. Anthony of the Desert and St. Benedict established monastic ways of life, preserving learning, agriculture, and spirituality through the collapse of the Roman Empire.
    </p>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-arrows-left-right"></i> The Great Schism (1054 AD)</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        Over centuries, cultural and theological differences grew between the Latin West (centered in Rome) and the Greek East (centered in Constantinople). This led to a tragic split in 1054, creating the division between the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Churches.
    </p>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-building-columns"></i> The High Middle Ages (c. 1000–1300 AD)</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        The medieval period was a time of immense intellectual and spiritual flourishing. The first universities were founded, and great cathedrals rose across Europe as testaments to faith. Theologians like St. Thomas Aquinas used reason to explore the mysteries of God (Scholasticism). New religious orders, such as the Franciscans and Dominicans, renewed the Church through poverty and preaching.
    </p>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-rotate"></i> The Protestant Reformation and Catholic Renewal (16th Century)</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        In the 1500s, political upheavals and theological disputes led to the Protestant Reformation, which fractured Western Christianity. The Church responded with the Council of Trent (1545–1563), which clarified doctrines on salvation and the sacraments, and instituted major reforms. This era, often called the Counter-Reformation, produced great saints like Ignatius of Loyola, Teresa of Avila, and Philip Neri.
    </p>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-globe"></i> The Church in the Modern World (17th–20th Centuries)</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        As European explorers traveled the globe, Catholic missionaries carried the Gospel to the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Saints like Francis Xavier and the North American Martyrs witnessed to Christ in new lands. In Europe, the Church faced the challenges of the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, and the rise of totalitarian regimes in the 20th century.
    </p>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-people-group"></i> The Second Vatican Council (1962–1965)</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        To address the Church's relationship with the modern world, Pope St. John XXIII convened the Second Vatican Council. The Council emphasized the universal call to holiness, the active participation of the laity, and the importance of ecumenism. Its documents continue to guide the Church's mission today.
