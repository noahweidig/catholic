    <h1>What Catholics Believe</h1>

    <p>
        The Catholic faith is built upon the revelation of God to humanity, entrusted to the Church. It is not a collection of opinions, but a coherent body of truth that illuminates the meaning of our existence.
    </p>

    <h2>The Most Holy Trinity</h2>
    <p>
        We believe in one God who is eternally three distinct persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. This is the central mystery of the Christian faith (see <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P17.HTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CCC 232-267</a>). The Trinity is a communion of love, and we are created in the image of this love.
    </p>

    <h2>Jesus Christ</h2>
    <p>
        We believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Second Person of the Trinity, who became man to save us from sin and death. He is fully God and fully man (see <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P1J.HTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CCC 464-483</a>). Through his life, passion, death, and resurrection, he opened the gates of heaven and reconciled humanity with God.
    </p>

    <h2>The Church</h2>
    <p>
        We believe that the Catholic Church is the Body of Christ on earth, established by Jesus himself (see <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P29.HTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CCC 751-776</a>). It is "one, holy, catholic, and apostolic." Through the Church, Christ continues his saving work, dispensing grace and teaching the truth with authority.
    </p>

    <h2>Scripture and Tradition</h2>
    <p>
        Divine Revelation is transmitted through two distinct but closely connected modes: <a href="https://bible.usccb.org/bible" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sacred Scripture (the Bible)</a> and Sacred Tradition. Together, they form a single deposit of faith. The <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P2A.HTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magisterium</a>—the teaching office of the Church—serves this deposit by authentically interpreting the Word of God.
    </p>

    <h2>Salvation and Grace</h2>
    <p>
        We believe that we are saved by grace through faith and works (see <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P6S.HTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CCC 1987-2029</a>). Salvation is a free gift from God, but we must cooperate with that gift through our choices and actions. The goal of our life is beatitude: eternal happiness with God in heaven.
    </p>

    <h2>The Communion of Saints</h2>
    <p>
        The Church is not limited to those currently living on earth. It includes the saints in heaven and the souls in purgatory. We are all united in the Body of Christ. We ask the saints, and especially Mary, the Mother of God, to pray for us, just as we ask our friends on earth to pray for us.
    </p>

    <h2>The Precepts of the Church</h2>
    <p>
        The Precepts of the Church are the minimum level of commitment required of the faithful (see <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P75.HTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CCC 2041-2043</a>).
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You shall attend Mass on Sundays and on holy days of obligation and rest from servile labor.</li>
        <li>You shall confess your sins at least once a year.</li>
        <li>You shall receive the sacrament of the Eucharist at least during the Easter season.</li>
        <li>You shall observe the days of fasting and abstinence established by the Church.</li>
        <li>You shall help to provide for the needs of the Church.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Four Last Things</h2>
    <p>
        The Church teaches that every human life has an eternal destiny. The "Four Last Things" are Death, Judgment, Heaven, and Hell. At the moment of death, each soul undergoes a particular judgment. Those who die in God's grace and friendship and are perfectly purified live for ever with Christ in Heaven. Those who die in God's grace, but are still imperfectly purified, are assured of their eternal salvation; but after death they undergo purification (Purgatory), so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven. Those who die in a state of mortal sin, without repentance, separate themselves from God forever (Hell).
