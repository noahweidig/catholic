    <h1>What Catholics Believe</h1>

    <p>
        The Catholic faith is built upon the revelation of God to humanity, entrusted to the Church. It is not a collection of opinions, but a coherent body of truth that illuminates the meaning of our existence.
    </p>

    <h2>The Most Holy Trinity</h2>
    <p>
        We believe in one God who is eternally three distinct persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. This is the central mystery of the Christian faith. The Trinity is a communion of love, and we are created in the image of this love.
    </p>

    <h2>Jesus Christ</h2>
    <p>
        We believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Second Person of the Trinity, who became man to save us from sin and death. He is fully God and fully man. Through his life, passion, death, and resurrection, he opened the gates of heaven and reconciled humanity with God.
    </p>

    <h2>The Church</h2>
    <p>
        We believe that the Catholic Church is the Body of Christ on earth, established by Jesus himself. It is "one, holy, catholic, and apostolic." Through the Church, Christ continues his saving work, dispensing grace and teaching the truth with authority.
    </p>

    <h2>Scripture and Tradition</h2>
    <p>
        Divine Revelation is transmitted through two distinct but closely connected modes: Sacred Scripture (the Bible) and Sacred Tradition. Together, they form a single deposit of faith. The Magisterium—the teaching office of the Church—serves this deposit by authentically interpreting the Word of God.
    </p>

    <h2>Salvation and Grace</h2>
    <p>
        We believe that we are saved by grace through faith and works. Salvation is a free gift from God, but we must cooperate with that gift through our choices and actions. The goal of our life is beatitude: eternal happiness with God in heaven.
