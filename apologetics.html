    <h1>Scriptural Defense</h1>

    <p>
        "Always be prepared to make a defense to anyone who calls you to account for the hope that is in you, yet do it with gentleness and reverence." (1 Peter 3:15). The Catholic faith is deeply rooted in the Bible. Here are the scriptural foundations for some commonly questioned Catholic beliefs.
    </p>

    <h2>The Real Presence in the Eucharist</h2>
    <p>
        Catholics believe that the Eucharist is truly the Body and Blood of Christ, not just a symbol.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "Jesus said to them, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you... For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.'"
        <br>— John 6:53-55
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        At the Last Supper, he said, "This is my body" and "This is my blood," not "This represents my body" (Matthew 26:26-28).
    </p>

    <h2>The Authority of the Pope</h2>
    <p>
        Jesus established a visible Church with Peter as its head.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the powers of death shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."
        <br>— Matthew 16:18-19
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Confession to a Priest</h2>
    <p>
        Jesus gave his Apostles the authority to forgive sins.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "Jesus said to them again, 'Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you.' And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.'"
        <br>— John 20:21-23
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Mary, Mother of God</h2>
    <p>
        Mary is honored because of her unique role in salvation history.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you!"
        <br>— Luke 1:28
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        "For behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed."
        <br>— Luke 1:48
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Jesus gave Mary to us as our mother from the Cross: "Behold, your mother!" (John 19:27).
    </p>

    <h2>Faith and Works</h2>
    <p>
        We are saved by grace, but true faith works through love.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        "You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone... For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so faith apart from works is dead."
        <br>— James 2:24, 26
