    <h1>Prayer &amp; Devotion</h1>
    <p>Raising one's mind and heart to God</p>
</section>

<main id="main-content">
    <p class="reveal">
        Prayer is the raising of one's mind and heart to God. It is the lifeblood of the soul. Catholic tradition offers a rich treasure of prayer forms, from the liturgical public prayer of the Church to private devotions.
    </p>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-place-of-worship"></i> The Holy Mass</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        The Mass is the central act of divine worship in the Catholic Church. It is not merely a communal gathering but a participation in the heavenly liturgy. We gather to listen to the Word of God and to receive the Eucharist, uniting our lives with the sacrifice of Christ. The Mass follows a structure rooted in the earliest centuries of Christianity.
    </p>

    <div class="mass-part reveal">
        <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-door-open"></i> The Introductory Rites</h3>
        <p>The faithful gather as the Body of Christ. The Introductory Rites prepare us to hear God's Word and to celebrate the Eucharist worthily.</p>
        <details>
            <summary>Entrance &amp; Greeting</summary>
            <p>The priest processes to the altar while the entrance hymn is sung. He venerates the altar with a kiss and greets the assembly: "The Lord be with you." The gathered people respond: "And with your spirit."</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Penitential Act</summary>
            <p>The assembly acknowledges its sinfulness and asks for God's mercy. The Confiteor ("I confess to almighty God...") or the Kyrie ("Lord, have mercy") is prayed, preparing our hearts to receive grace.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Gloria</summary>
            <p>On Sundays (outside Advent and Lent) and solemnities, the ancient hymn of praise is sung: "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to people of good will..." This great doxology echoes the song of the angels at Christ's birth.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Collect</summary>
            <p>The priest "collects" the prayers of the faithful into one opening prayer, addressed to God the Father through Christ in the Holy Spirit. The people respond: "Amen."</p>
        </details>
    </div>

    <div class="mass-part reveal">
        <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i> The Liturgy of the Word</h3>
        <p>God speaks to his people through Sacred Scripture. The readings are not merely historical texts but the living Word of God addressed to us here and now.</p>
        <details>
            <summary>First Reading</summary>
            <p>Typically taken from the Old Testament (or Acts during Easter season), this reading reveals God's saving action in history and prepares us for the fullness of revelation in Christ.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Responsorial Psalm</summary>
            <p>A Psalm is sung or recited in response to the First Reading. The assembly joins in a repeated refrain, making the prayer of Israel their own.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Second Reading</summary>
            <p>On Sundays and solemnities, a second reading is taken from the New Testament letters (Epistles) or the Book of Revelation, offering instruction in the apostolic faith.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Gospel</summary>
            <p>The assembly stands as the Gospel is proclaimed. This is the high point of the Liturgy of the Word: we hear the very words and deeds of Jesus Christ. The deacon or priest proclaims the reading, and the people respond: "Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ."</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Homily</summary>
            <p>The priest or deacon breaks open the Word of God, applying the Scriptures to the life of the faithful. The homily is an integral part of the liturgy and connects God's Word to daily Christian living.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Profession of Faith (Creed)</summary>
            <p>On Sundays and solemnities, the assembly professes the Nicene Creed (or Apostles' Creed), publicly affirming the essential truths of the faith handed down from the Apostles.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Universal Prayer (Prayer of the Faithful)</summary>
            <p>The assembly prays for the needs of the Church, the world, the suffering, and the local community. The people respond to each petition: "Lord, hear our prayer."</p>
        </details>
    </div>

    <div class="mass-part reveal">
        <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-wheat-awn"></i> The Liturgy of the Eucharist</h3>
        <p>The heart of the Mass. Christ's sacrifice on Calvary is made present on the altar. Bread and wine become his Body and Blood, and the faithful are invited to Holy Communion.</p>
        <details>
            <summary>Preparation of the Gifts (Offertory)</summary>
            <p>Bread and wine are brought to the altar. The priest offers them to God: "Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation..." The gifts of the earth, the work of human hands, will become for us the Bread of Life and our spiritual drink.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Eucharistic Prayer</summary>
            <p>The great prayer of thanksgiving and consecration. It includes the Preface and Sanctus ("Holy, Holy, Holy"), the Epiclesis (invocation of the Holy Spirit upon the gifts), the Institution Narrative and Consecration (the priest speaks Christ's own words: "This is my Body... This is my Blood"), the Anamnesis (memorial of Christ's death and resurrection), and the Great Amen. Through the words of Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit, the bread and wine truly become the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>The Lord's Prayer</summary>
            <p>The assembly prays the prayer Jesus himself taught us: "Our Father, who art in heaven..." This prayer prepares us for Communion by asking for our daily bread and the forgiveness of our sins.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Sign of Peace</summary>
            <p>The faithful exchange a sign of peace with one another, expressing the unity and charity required before approaching the altar of God.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Fraction (Breaking of the Bread) &amp; Lamb of God</summary>
            <p>The priest breaks the consecrated Host while the Agnus Dei is sung: "Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us... grant us peace." This gesture recalls how Christ was broken for us.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Holy Communion</summary>
            <p>The faithful receive the Body and Blood of Christ. The minister says: "The Body of Christ," and the communicant responds: "Amen." In receiving Communion, we are united with Christ and with one another in the most intimate way possible on this side of heaven.</p>
        </details>
    </div>

    <div class="mass-part reveal">
        <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-paper-plane"></i> The Concluding Rites</h3>
        <p>The Mass ends as it began—with a blessing—and the faithful are sent forth to live what they have celebrated.</p>
        <details>
            <summary>Blessing &amp; Dismissal</summary>
            <p>The priest blesses the people in the name of the Trinity. The deacon (or priest) then dismisses the assembly with words such as: "Go forth, the Mass is ended" or "Go and announce the Gospel of the Lord." The people respond: "Thanks be to God." The word "Mass" itself comes from the Latin <em>missa</em> (dismissal)—we are sent on mission.</p>
        </details>
    </div>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-notch"></i> The Rosary</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        The Rosary is a meditative prayer focused on the life of Christ. While reciting prayers like the Hail Mary, we contemplate the "mysteries" of the Gospel—the Joyful, Luminous, Sorrowful, and Glorious moments in the lives of Jesus and Mary. It is a powerful tool for peace and spiritual growth.
