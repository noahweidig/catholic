    <h1>Scriptural Defense</h1>
    <p>Always be prepared to give a reason for the hope that is in you</p>
</section>

<main>
    <p class="reveal">
        "Always be prepared to make a defense to anyone who calls you to account for the hope that is in you, yet do it with gentleness and reverence." (1 Peter 3:15). The Catholic faith is deeply rooted in the Bible. Here are the scriptural foundations for some commonly questioned Catholic beliefs.
    </p>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-wheat-awn"></i> The Real Presence in the Eucharist</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        Catholics believe that the Eucharist is truly the Body and Blood of Christ, not just a symbol.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="reveal">
        "Jesus said to them, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you... For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.'"
        <br>— <a href="https://bible.usccb.org/bible/john/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 6:53-55</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="reveal">
        At the Last Supper, he said, "This is my body" and "This is my blood," not "This represents my body" (<a href="https://bible.usccb.org/bible/matthew/26" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 26:26-28</a>).
    </p>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-key"></i> The Authority of the Pope</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        Jesus established a visible Church with Peter as its head.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="reveal">
        "And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the powers of death shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."
        <br>— <a href="https://bible.usccb.org/bible/matthew/16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 16:18-19</a>
    </blockquote>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-hands"></i> Confession to a Priest</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        Jesus gave his Apostles the authority to forgive sins.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="reveal">
        "Jesus said to them again, 'Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you.' And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.'"
        <br>— <a href="https://bible.usccb.org/bible/john/20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 20:21-23</a>
    </blockquote>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i> Mary, Mother of God</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        Mary is honored because of her unique role in salvation history.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="reveal">
        "Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you!"
        <br>— <a href="https://bible.usccb.org/bible/luke/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 1:28</a>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="reveal">
        "For behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed."
        <br>— <a href="https://bible.usccb.org/bible/luke/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 1:48</a>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="reveal">
        Jesus gave Mary to us as our mother from the Cross: "Behold, your mother!" (<a href="https://bible.usccb.org/bible/john/19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 19:27</a>).
    </p>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-hands-holding"></i> Faith and Works</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        We are saved by grace, but true faith works through love.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="reveal">
        "You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone... For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so faith apart from works is dead."
        <br>— <a href="https://bible.usccb.org/bible/james/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 2:24, 26</a>
    </blockquote>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-cloud"></i> The Intercession of Saints</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        Catholics ask the saints in heaven to pray for them, just as we ask fellow Christians on earth for prayers.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="reveal">
        "And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp, and with golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints."
        <br>— <a href="https://bible.usccb.org/bible/revelation/5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 5:8</a>
    </blockquote>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-fire"></i> Purgatory</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        Scripture indicates a state of purification for those who die in God's friendship but are still imperfectly purified.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="reveal">
        "It is therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead, that they may be loosed from sins."
        <br>— <a href="https://bible.usccb.org/bible/2maccabees/12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Maccabees 12:46</a>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="reveal">
        "If any man's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire."
        <br>— <a href="https://bible.usccb.org/bible/1corinthians/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 3:15</a>
    </blockquote>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-scroll"></i> Sacred Tradition</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        The Bible itself affirms that not everything was written down and that we must hold fast to oral tradition.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="reveal">
        "So then, brethren, stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught by us, either by word of mouth or by letter."
        <br>— <a href="https://bible.usccb.org/bible/2thessalonians/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Thessalonians 2:15</a>
    </blockquote>

    <h2 class="reveal"><i class="fa-solid fa-water"></i> Infant Baptism</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
        Baptism replaces circumcision as the sign of the covenant, and in the New Testament, entire households were baptized.
    </p>
    <blockquote class="reveal">
        "And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their wounds, and he was baptized at once, with all his family."
        <br>— <a href="https://bible.usccb.org/bible/acts/16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 16:33</a>
