    <h1>Church History</h1>

    <p>
        The history of the Church is the story of the Holy Spirit guiding the People of God through time. It is a history of saints and sinners, of struggle and triumph, all centered on the person of Jesus Christ.
    </p>

    <h2>The Apostolic Age (c. 33–100 AD)</h2>
    <p>
        The Church began at Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit descended upon the Apostles, empowering them to preach the Gospel to all nations. Led by Peter and Paul, the early Christians spread the faith throughout the Roman Empire, often facing severe persecution. This era gave us the New Testament writings and the Didache.
    </p>

    <h2>The Age of Martyrs (c. 100–313 AD)</h2>
    <p>
        For the first three centuries, Christianity was illegal. Thousands of believers, from bishops like Ignatius of Antioch to young women like Agnes and Perpetua, gave their lives rather than deny Christ. As Tertullian famously wrote, "The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church." Despite the danger, the faith grew rapidly.
    </p>

    <h2>The Church Fathers and the Councils (c. 313–600 AD)</h2>
    <p>
        With the Edict of Milan in 313 AD, Emperor Constantine legalized Christianity. This allowed the Church to clarify her teachings publicly. Great thinkers known as the Church Fathers (such as Augustine, Ambrose, and Athanasius) defended the faith against heresies. Ecumenical Councils were held to define core doctrines:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Council of Nicaea (325 AD):</strong> Affirmed that Jesus is truly God, of the same substance (consubstantial) as the Father.</li>
        <li><strong>Council of Ephesus (431 AD):</strong> Proclaimed Mary as <em>Theotokos</em>, the Mother of God.</li>
        <li><strong>Council of Chalcedon (451 AD):</strong> Defined that Jesus is one person with two natures, fully human and fully divine.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Monasticism</h2>
    <p>
        As persecution ceased, some sought a "white martyrdom" of self-denial. St. Anthony of the Desert and St. Benedict established monastic ways of life, preserving learning, agriculture, and spirituality through the collapse of the Roman Empire.
    </p>

    <h2>The Great Schism (1054 AD)</h2>
    <p>
        Over centuries, cultural and theological differences grew between the Latin West (centered in Rome) and the Greek East (centered in Constantinople). This led to a tragic split in 1054, creating the division between the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Churches.
