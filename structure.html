    <h1>Structure of the Church</h1>

    <p>
        The Catholic Church is not merely a human organization, but the Body of Christ. Its structure is not about power, but about service and the faithful transmission of the Gospel. As St. Paul wrote, "And his gifts were that some should be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers" (Ephesians 4:11).
    </p>

    <h2>The Pope</h2>
    <p>
        The Pope, also known as the Supreme Pontiff, is the Bishop of Rome and the successor of Saint Peter. Jesus gave Peter the "keys of the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 16:19), establishing him as the rock on which the Church is built. The Pope serves as the visible source of unity for the universal Church and the Vicar of Christ on earth.
    </p>

    <h2>The College of Bishops</h2>
    <p>
        The bishops are the successors of the Apostles. United with the Pope, they form the College of Bishops. They are responsible for teaching, sanctifying, and governing the faithful in their respective dioceses. A bishop traces his authority back to the Apostles through an unbroken line of laying on of hands, known as Apostolic Succession.
    </p>

    <h2>Priests and Deacons</h2>
    <p>
        Priests are co-workers with the bishops. They are ordained to preach the Gospel, shepherd the faithful, and celebrate the sacraments, especially the Eucharist. Deacons are ordained for the ministry of service, assisting the bishop and priests in the celebration of the divine mysteries, in works of charity, and in proclaiming the Word.
    </p>

    <h2>The Laity</h2>
    <p>
        The laity consists of all the faithful who have not received Holy Orders or entered religious life. By virtue of their Baptism, they are called to be "salt of the earth" and "light of the world." Their specific mission is to sanctify the temporal world—families, workplaces, and communities—by living out the Gospel in their daily lives.
    </p>

    <h2>The Magisterium</h2>
    <p>
        The Magisterium is the living teaching office of the Church, consisting of the Pope and the bishops in communion with him. Its task is to give an authentic interpretation of the Word of God, whether in its written form (Scripture) or in the form of Tradition. The Magisterium is not superior to the Word of God, but is its servant.
    </p>

    <h2>Religious Life</h2>
    <p>
        While not part of the hierarchy in the same way, men and women in religious life (monks, nuns, friars, sisters) play a vital role. They profess vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, dedicating their lives entirely to God and witnessing to the reality of the Kingdom of Heaven.
