    <h1>Welcome</h1>

    <p class="drop-cap">
        The Catholic faith is a journey of love, truth, and beauty that has been walked by countless souls for two thousand years. It is an invitation to encounter Jesus Christ, not merely as a historical figure, but as a living presence who offers us life in abundance.
    </p>

    <p>
        In a world often filled with noise and confusion, the Church stands as a sanctuary of peace and a beacon of hope. Her teachings are not arbitrary rules, but a roadmap to human flourishing and eternal joy, handed down through Scripture and Tradition.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        "Late have I loved you, beauty so old and so new: late have I loved you."
        <br>— St. Augustine
